### Second kind (Stirling partition number)

$$\left\{ {n \atop k}\right\} = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^{i} \binom{k}{i} (k-i)^n.
$$

The Stirling numbers of the second kind, written $S(n,k)$ or $\lbrace\textstyle{n\atop k}\rbrace$ or with other notations, count the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ labelled objects into $k$ nonempty unlabelled subsets. 

Equivalently, they count the number of different **equivalence relations** with precisely $k$ equivalence classes that can be defined on an $n$ element set.

### Relation to [[Bell numbers]]
Since the Stirling number $\lbrace\textstyle{n\atop k}\rbrace$ counts set partitions of an $n$-element set into $k$ parts, the sum $$B_n=\sum_{k=0}^n \left\{ {n \atop k} \right\}$$ over all values of $k$ is the total number of partitions of a set with $n$ members.
