- find a basis for $\text{Sp}(K)\cap\text{Sp}(L)$


- Given a matrix $A$ in which some entries are dependent in varible $a$. find the $a$ values such that $A$ is diagonalizable. 
	 - Find the eigenvalues of $A$ using characteristic polynomial.
	 - Find the values of $a$, for which the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue $\lambda_{i}$ is equal to its geometric multiplicity which is $\dim{(\lambda_{i}I-A)}=n-\text{rank}(\lambda_{i}I-A)$.
