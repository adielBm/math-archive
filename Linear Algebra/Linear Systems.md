## Solving Linear Systems 

- Gaussian elimination (REF)
- Gauss–Jordan elimination (RREF)
- If $A$ is an invertible $n×n$ matrix, then for every $n×1$ matrix $\textbf{b}$, the system of equations $A\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$ has exactly one solution, namely, $\textbf{x}=A^{−1}\textbf{b}$ 
- (4.6.1) Cramer's rule 

## consistency 

whether a linear system is consistent 

- Rouché–Capelli theorem (8.6.2) - A system of linear equations with $n$ variables has a solution, if and only if, the rank of its coefficient matrix $A$ is equal to the rank of its augmented matrix $[A|b]$. That is $\rho([A|B])=\rho(A)$
