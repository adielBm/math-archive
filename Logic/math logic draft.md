- $\Sigma$ **tautologically implies** $\uptau$ (written $\Sigma\models\uptau$) iff every truth assignment for the sentence symbols in $\Sigma$ and $\uptau$ that satisfies every member of $\Sigma$ also satisfies $\uptau$
- A set $\Sigma$ of expressions is **decidable** iff there exists an effective procedure that, given an expression $α$, will decide whether or not $α ∈ \Sigma$
- A set $A$ of expressions is **semidecidable** iff there exists an effective procedure that, given any expression $ε$, produces the answer “yes” iff $ε ∈ A$. 



- **propositional symbols** (aka: sentential symbols, sentential variables, propositional variables)
- **truth assignment** (or **valuation function**) is a function that maps each propositional symbol to one of the truth values true and false
