- **Proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both
- **Statement** is what typically asserted by a declarative sentence, but not the sentence itself. Every statement must be either true or false, although the truth or falsity of a given statement may be unknown.



- An **Argument** is any set of propositions of which one, the conclusion, is claimed to be supported by the others, the premises. The conclusion of an argument is inferred from the premises of the argument.
