 the set of words over a given alphabet with the concatenation operation. any finite or infinite set $Σ$ of letters (arbitrary symbols) is called an **alphabet** or **keyboard**. The set of strings, i.e., finite sequences of letters, is called the set of words over Σ, denoted by $Σ^*$. In $Σ^*$, the concatenation operation is defined:
α⋅β is the string composed of the concatenation of α and β. Its beginning is the string α, and its continuation is the string β. If a word can be written as α⋅β, then α is the prefix of the word, and β is its suffix.
The set of words and the inherent properties of the concatenation operation, as well as the concepts of "prefix of a word" and "suffix of a word," will be essential in this course.
