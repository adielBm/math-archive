- Given a pair of straight lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$, there are three possibilities:
	- The lines converge: $\ell_2 = \ell_1$.
	- The lines are parallel: $\ell_2 \parallel \ell_1$.
	- The lines intersect at exactly one point.
- Axiom 8.2 - Given two points that are different from each other, $A$ and $B$, there is one and only one straight line that passes through both of them.
- Axiom 8.3 - Given a line $\ell$ and a point $A$ that is not on the line, there exists $m$ unique line passing through the point $A$ and parallel to the straight line

- Theorem 8.5 - Two straight lines, parallel to a third straight line, are identical or parallel.
- Conclusion 8.6 Given two parallel lines $\ell_2 \parallel \ell_1$, any straight line intersected with $\ell_1$ also cuts $\ell_2$.


- Let $\ell$ be straight and let $P$ be a point. Then there is a single straight line passing through $P$ and perpendicular to $\ell$.
