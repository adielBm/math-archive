- A **polygon** is a closed plane figure whose sides are line segments that intersect only at the endpoints.
- A **diagonal of a polygon** is a line segment that joins two nonconsecutive vertices
	- The total number of diagonals $D$ in a polygon of $n$ sides is given by the formula $D=\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$


- The **perimeter of a polygon** is the sum of the lengths of all sides of the polygon.


- A **regular polygon** is a polygon that is both equilateral and equiangular.

- The sum of the measures of the exterior angles of a polygon, one at each vertex, is 360Â°

- A **convex polygon** is a polygon that every internal angle is strictly less than 180 degrees
	- A polygon is convex if and only if for every two points in the polygon, the segment connecting them is found in the polygon.
- The sum $S$ of the measures of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is given by $S=(n-2)\cdot180^\circ$. Note that $n>2$ for any polygon.
