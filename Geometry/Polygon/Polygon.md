- A **convex polygon** is a polygon that every internal angle is strictly less than 180 degrees
	- A polygon is convex if and only if for every two points in the polygon, the segment connecting them is found in the polygon.
- The sum of the angles in a convex polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees
