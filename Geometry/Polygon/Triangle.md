- All triangles are convex
- The sum of the angles in each triangle is $180^\circ$.
- **The Triangle Inequality** - The length of each side in a triangle is less than the sum of the lengths of the other sides.
- If $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive real numbers each of which is less than the sum of the other two, then you can build a triangle whose side lengths are $a$, $b$, and $c$.

## Area

- $\displaystyle\frac{{h_{b}b}}{2}$
- **Heron formula** - Given a triangle whose side lengths are $a$, $b$, and $c$, let $p = \frac{a + b + c}{2}$ and then $S = \sqrt{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)}$ is the area of the triangle.


# Types

- **Equilateral triangle** 
	- In a triangle, all of whose sides are equal to each other, all the angles are also equal to each other.
- **Isosceles triangle**
	- In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal to each other.
	- If two angles in a triangle are equal in size, then the opposite sides are equal in length.
	- A triangle is isosceles if and only if two of its angles are equal to each other
	- Let $\triangle{ABC}$ be an isosceles triangle, suppose $\overline{AB} = \overline{AC}$. then the altitude, median, and angle bisector from the vertex $A$ all coincide
- **Right triangle**
	- **Pythagoras theorem** - In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the perpendiculars: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

# Line Segments

- A **median** of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side, thus bisecting that side
- An **angle bisector** is a straight line drawn from the vertex of a triangle to its opposite side in such a way, that it divides the angle into two equal or congruent angles.
- An **altitude** of a triangle is a line segment through a vertex and perpendicular to a line containing the side opposite the vertex.
	- The three altitudes in a triangular triangle (or their continuations) meet at one point.
- The **perpendicular bisector** of a line segment is a line which meets the segment at its midpoint perpendicularly.



# Congruence $\cong$

- Triangle Congruence Theorem
	- **SAS** (side-angle-side): If two pairs of sides of two triangles are equal in length, and the included angles are equal in measurement, then the triangles are congruent.
	- **SSS** (side-side-side): If three pairs of sides of two triangles are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent.
	- **ASA** (angle-side-angle): If two pairs of angles of two triangles are equal in measurement, and the included sides are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent.
	- **SSA** (side-side-angle) If two triangles equal in size to two sides and the angle opposite the larger side, then the triangles are congruent.

# Similarity $\sim$

- Given the triangles $\triangle A'B'C'$ and $\triangle ABC$
	- If $\frac{\overline{AB}}{\overline{A'B'}}=\frac{\overline{BC}}{\overline{B'C'}}=\frac{\overline{AC}}{\overline{A'C'}}$ then $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle A'B'C'$
	- If it holds that the angles are equal: $\sphericalangle{A}=\sphericalangle{A'}, \sphericalangle{B}=\sphericalangle{B'}, \sphericalangle{C}=\sphericalangle{C'}$ then $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle A'B'C'$
