## Definitions 

- A **polynomial function of degree** $n$ is a function of the form $p(x)=\displaystyle  {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}x^{i}}$ where $n$ is a nonnegative integer and and $a_{n}\neq 0$,
- $a_{0},a_{1},\dots,a_{n}$ are called the **coefficients** of the polynomial
	- $a_{0}$ is the **constant coefficient** or **constant term**
	- $a_{n}$ is the **leading coefficient**, and $a_{n}x^n$ is the **leading term**
- $n=\deg{p}$ is the polynomial degree 
- A number $c$ is called **a root of** $p(x)$ if $p(c)=0$
- $p(x)=0$ is the zero polynomial. (its degree is $-1$, $-\infty$ or undefined)
- $p_{2}\mid{p_{1}}$ ($p_{2}$ **divides** $p_{1}$, or $p_{1}$ **is divided by** $p_{2}$) if there exists polynomial $q$ such that $p_{1}=p_{2}q$

## Theorems 

- **Factor theorem:** $p(c)=0\iff p(x)=(x-c)q(x)$. (where $\deg{q}=(n-1)$
	- In words: $c$ is a root of the polynomial $p$ (of degree n) if and only if $(xâˆ’c)$ is a factor of $p$
- if $\deg{p}=n\geq 0$ then $p$ has at most $n$ real roots
- Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial of odd degree. Then $p$ has at least one real root.
