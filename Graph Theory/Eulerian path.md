**Eulerian path** is a path in a finite graph that visits every edge exactly once. Similarly, an **Eulerian circuit** or **Eulerian cycle** is an Eulerian path that starts and ends on the same vertex.
A graph that contains a Eulerian cycle is called a **Eulerian graph**.


### Theorems
- A graph $G$ has an **Euler circuit** if and only if, $G$ is connected and every vertex of G has positive **even degree**.
- Let $G$ be a graph, and let $v$ and $u$ be two distinct vertices of G. There is an **Eulerian path** from $v$ to $u$ if, and only if, $G$ is connected, $v$ and $u$ have odd degree, and all other vertices of $G$ have positive even degree.^[question 1]
