Hamiltonian path is a path in an undirected or directed graph that **visits each vertex exactly once**. A **Hamiltonian cycle** (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once.

A graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle is called a **Hamiltonian graph**.

##### Dirac's Theorem (3.3)
A simple graph with $n$ vertices ($n\geq 3$) is **Hamiltonian** if every vertex has degree $\frac{n}{2}$ or greater. 

##### Ore's Theorem (3.2)
A simple graph with $n$ vertices ($n\geq 3$) is **Hamiltonian** if, for every pair of non-adjacent vertices, the sum of their degrees is $n$ or greater.
