- A **path** is a trail in which all vertices (and therefore also all edges) are **distinct**.
- **cycle** in a graph is a non-empty trail in which only the first and last vertices are equal.

### Theorems
- if the graph $G$ is connected, and each vertex has degree 2, then $G$ is a cycle. (*question 2*).
