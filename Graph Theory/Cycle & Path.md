- **Walk** - is a finite or infinite sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices. 
- **Trail** (*מסלול*) - is a walk in which all edges are **distinct**.
- **Path** (*מסלול פשוט*) - is a trail in which all vertices (and therefore also all edges) are **distinct**.
- **Circuit** (*מעגל, מסלול סגור*) - is a non-empty trail in which the first and last vertices are equal.
- **Cycle** (*מעגל פשוט*) - is a non-empty trail in which only the first and last vertices are equal.
- **Cycle graph** is a graph that consists of a single cycle.
- A cycle with an even number of vertices is called an **even cycle**; a cycle with an odd number of vertices is called an **odd cycle**.

### Theorems
- Let $G=(V,E)$ a [[connected graph]], and $|V|\leq|E|$, then there is a cycle in the graph.
- Let $G$ a [[connected graph]], and each vertex has degree 2, then $G$ is a Cycle graph. (*question 2*).
