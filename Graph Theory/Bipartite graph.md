**bipartite graph** $G=(V,U,E)$ is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets $U$ and $V$, that is every edge connects a vertex in $U$ to one in $V$. 

- **Theorem 1.6** - A graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain an odd cycle.
- **Subgraph of a Bipartite Graph** - Every subgraph H of a bipartite graph G is, itself, bipartite. 
^[question 5].
- **KÅ‘nig's theorem (4.16)** - In bipartite graphs, the size of minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching. $\beta(G)=\nu(G)$.
