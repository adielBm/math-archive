### Theorems

- **Theorem 2.5 - Number of edges** - Let $G=(V,E)$ be tree, so $|E|=|V|-1$.
- Tree with at least 2 vertices has **at least 2 leaves**. (question 2.3)
- 

# Forest
### Properties of Forest
$k$ is num of components (or trees).
$$k=|V|-|E| \text{ or } |E|=|V|-k$$


# Cayley's formula

- **Prüfer sequence** of a labeled tree is a unique sequence associated with the tree. The sequence for a tree on $n$ vertices has length $n−2$
- There is **Bijection between Prüfer Sequences and Labeled Trees.** That is, every labeled tree has a unique Prüfer sequence that defines it, and every Prüfer sequence defines just one labeled tree. 
- **Cayley's formula** (2.9) - The number of labeled trees with $n$ vertices is $n^{n−2}$
