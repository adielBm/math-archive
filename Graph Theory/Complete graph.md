a **complete graph** is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. the complete graph on $n$ vertices is denoted by $K_n$

- Number of **Edges** in complete graph $K_n$ is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}=\binom{n}{2}$. ^[Triangle number]
- Number of **Perfect Matchings** in complete graph $K_n$ is double-factorial $(n-1)!!$.
