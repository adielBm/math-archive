a regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors; i.e. every vertex has the same degree. 
A regular graph with vertices of degree $k$ is called a $k$â€‘regular graph or regular graph of degree $k$. 


- from the [[handshaking lemma]], a regular graph contains an even number of vertices with odd degree.
