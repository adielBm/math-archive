Here is a step-by-step general method to find a basis for the null space of a matrix $A$:

1. **Row reduce** the matrix $A$ to its **reduced row echelon form (RREF)**¹²³.
2. Identify the columns of the RREF that do not contain any of the leading row entries. These columns correspond to the **free variables** of the solution set to $Ax = 0$².
3. Assign any value to the free variables and solve for the other variables².
4. Rewrite the solution as a **linear combination of vectors**. The weights will be the free variables³.
5. The resulting vectors form a basis for the null space of $A$³.

This method will always produce a basis for the null space of a matrix². Is there anything else you would like to know?
