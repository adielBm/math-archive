- An **interior point** of an interval $I$ isÂ an element of $I$ which is not an endpoint of $I$


Definition:
If I is an interval and also $x\in I$
- We say that x is a right endpoint of I if x=max I ; 
- We say that x is a left endpoint of I if x=min I ; 
- And in any other case we say that x is an interior point of I.


If I is an interval and $x\in I$:
- x is called the right endpoint of I if x=max I;
- x is called the left endpoint of I if x=min I;
- In any other case, x is referred to as an interior point of I.
