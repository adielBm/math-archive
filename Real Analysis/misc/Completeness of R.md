- (a1.52) Let $\emptyset\neq A,B\subset\mathbb{R}$ then $\forall{a}\in{A},\forall{b}\in{B},a\leq b~\implies~\exists x\in\mathbb{R}:\forall{a}\in{A},a\leq{x}\land\forall{b}\in{B},x\leq{b}$

The property of completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ may be formalised in several equivalent ways. 

- **Dedekind’s separability axiom**: decomposing R into the union of two disjoint subsets $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ (the pair $(C_{1}, C_{2})$ is called a **cut**) so that each element of $C_{1}$ is smaller or equal than every element in $C_{2}$, there exists a (unique) separating element $s ∈ R: x1 ≤ s ≤ x2, ∀x1 ∈ C1, ∀x2 ∈ C2$. 


- Every bounded set from above admits a supremum in $\mathbb{R}$, i.e., there is a real number smaller or equal than all upper bounds of the set. 


# Construction of the real numbers


- Given two complete totally ordered fields, there is a unique isomorphism between them. This implies that the identity is the unique field automorphism of the reals that is compatible with the ordering.
