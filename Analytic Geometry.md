- **Distance Formula** - The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula $d=\sqrt{ (x_{2}-x_{1})^2+(y_{2}-y_{1})^2 }$
- **Midpoint Formula** - The midpoint $M$ of the line segment joining the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\displaystyle M=(\frac{{x_{1}+x_{2}}}{2},\frac{{y_{1}+y_{2}}}{2})$

> $m$ = slope of the line, $b$ = y-intercept, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are two points 

- **Angle Between Two Lines** - If two nonperpendicular lines have slopes $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, then the tangent of the angle between the two lines is $\tan \theta={|{\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{1+m_{1}m_{2}}}|}$

- If two nonvertical lines are parallel, then their slopes are equal.
	- Alternative Form: $\ell_{1}\parallel \ell_{2}\iff m_{1}=m_{2}$
- If two lines (neither horizontal nor vertical) are perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is $-1$. 
	- Alternative Form: $\ell_{1}\perp \ell_{2}\iff m_{1}m_{2}=-1$ where neither $\ell_{1}$ nor $\ell_{2}$ is a vertical line or a horizontal line.
